# JNVR Portfolio

This project contains an Ionic/Angular application showcasing projects and experience. Some design elements are inspired by [Brittany Chiang's portfolio](https://brittanychiang.com).


## Design

The interface uses the **Poppins** font from Google Fonts and a clean light theme
with a blue primary color. The layout has been simplified for a professional
portfolio presentation.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

Run the development server with live reload:

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Unit Tests

The project uses Karma and Jasmine. Execute tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

Note: a Chrome browser or compatible headless binary is required. Set the `CHROME_BIN` environment variable if running in a minimal environment.

## Deployment

Build the production files with:

```bash
npm run build
```

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
